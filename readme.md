# Tenzies project scrimba

## Introduction

This was the last project from Scrimba, build from scratch. 

It has definitely been a fun game to work on. We added a bunch of functionalities, rolling only dice that are not marked yet, making button change after the game is finished and a fun confetti at the end. 

Will look into extending this game.
